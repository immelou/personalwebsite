                <h2>Annyeong I'm Immelou!</h2>
                <p> I am Immelou Doria, already turns 21 last December. And wants to become a
                    bookworm by learning everything from the book, which I love the most. I also
                    love making crochets but never finished one of it, because I'm
                    running out of budgets for my materials. I am currently in my 3rd year 1st
                    semester and experiencing so much stress and anxiety, because that's a college
                    life is! And my no.1 stress reliever is listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6CTPNZf8oOSfzGX6r3LQYS?si=3f93f623b0c64627">
                    SKYPODCAST</a>~!
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>My "Learning Korean Language" Journey</h3>
                <p>I spend most of my vacation in k-dramas and korean culture. Like the Netflix's 
                    <a href="https://www.netflix.com/ph-en/title/81610166">Korea No.1</a>
                    which I really love Lee Kwang Soo (from Running Man), Yu Jae Seok (Korea's most 
                    popular MC) and Kim Yeon Koung (Korea'snational volleyball player). The most thing
                    I love in this show is they promote their country by learning on how koreans living
                    their life from the start. Like building roofs from the temples and making a paint 
                    fresh from a tree sap which cost million dollar (possible that only chaebols has this
                    expensive furniture). During my both watching and listening in koreans, I learned some
                    words that are commonly heared when you are a k-drama fan like: "Annyeonghaseyo",
                    "Hana Dul Set Ne Yeolso...", "Il, I, Ssam, Ssa...", "Oppa, Eomma, Eonni, Appa, Ahjussi,
                    Ahjumma, Halmeonni" and many more. Hangul letters are so difficult to write, because of
                    spelling, but you can easily learn how to read Hangul. Hoping for next year to learn more
                    Hangul~! *finger-cross*

                <h3>Music Taste</h3>
                <p>If I'm interested in Korean culture, it is also possible to like korean music!
                    I started to listen korean music when I was in my 3rd grade? I remember my younger self when
                    I was playing 'banduria' before, I want to covered a music with the help of k-pop. But
                    I am too young to think better ideas, and way back when we have a piano I played BTS <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEeFrLSkMm8">
                    Spring Day</a>, but too early to learn, my mom sell the piano and I just learn AKMU's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3DZsBw5bnE">
                    '어떻게 이별까지 사랑하겠어, 널 사랑하는 거지'</a> through my niece's Ipad. You can listen my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2zotyWbSsJjbULWulsLLo4?si=583b7c7374b04985&pt=db755942b5de77a41ecbfc6bef75f36a">
